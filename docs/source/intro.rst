Introduction
============

**Data Transfer Framework (DTF)** is an I/O middleware designed for achieving scalable and high-speed data transfer between components in multi-component workflows (e.g. real-time weather forecasting system).
It is implemented using Message Passing Interface (MPI), which transparently redirects PnetCDF file I/O operations to DTF library implementations.
